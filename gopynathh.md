# Project Name - Mechanical Keyboard ## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I am going to build my own mechanical keyboard to use for gaming and also for school work online. I never really had a good keyboard of my own to use and being able to game and even type with the keyboard would be a huge accomplishment and a different experience for me. I am excited to build it because it will be my first time building a keyboard and it is very essential to me since I use my PC every day for academic purposes.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

The steps that I am going to take to build it is to research parts on youtube, amazon, and keyboard websites to essentially see what would be suitable for me. The tools that I am going to use are mainly screwdrivers and lubricant if needed.

1. Pick the keyboard that catches my interest
1. Choose the parts online and also the tools required to build
1. Check if the pre-soldered PCB is well-matched with the keycaps and if it fits into the case
1. Lube switches and correct stabilizers to my needs
1. Insert stabilizers onto PCB
1. Put on switches onto the switch mounting plate and PCB
1. Install rubber/foam feet for grip on the case
1. Install the entire PCB with all parts into the case
1. Put on keycaps and start typing
